## 0. Notation

When writing logic expressions, we will often use
mathematical notation for "and", "or", and "not":

- $\wedge$ -- "and"
- $\vee$ -- "or"
- $\neg$ -- "not"

This notation is independent of any language; it could be turned into Java, or C, or Python -- each
of which uses different logical operators -- depending on what language our system and our
tests are implemented in.

If writing actual Java code, however, we use the normal
Java logical operators:

- `&&` -- "and"
- `||` -- "or"
- `!` -- "not"

<div style="border: solid 2pt blue; background-color: hsla(241, 100%,50%, 0.1); padding: 1em; border-radius: 5pt; margin-top: 1em;">

**Other operators and languages**

Java also has nonâ€“short-circuiting logic operators, `|` and `&`.

We won't be using any Python in this unit -- but for reference,
in Python, the logic operators are all spelled out as English words: "and", "or" and
"not".

## 1. Terminology -- clauses and predicates

If you need to, review the lecture material and recommended readings
that explain what
*predicates* and *clauses* are.

What are the *clauses* in the predicates below?


a.  $((f \leqslant g) \wedge (x > 0)) \vee (M \wedge (e < d +c))$

#.  $G \vee ((m > a) \vee (s \leqslant o + n)) \wedge U$



\solbox
<div class="solutions">

**Solutions**

a.  $((f \leqslant g) \wedge (x > 0)) \vee (M \wedge (e < d +c))$

    There are 4 clauses:

    i.  $f \leqslant g$
    #.  $x > 0$
    #.  $M$
    #.  $(e < d +c)$


#.  $G \vee ((m > a) \vee (s \leqslant o + n)) \wedge U$

    There are 4 clauses:

    i.  $G$
    #.  $m > a$
    #.  $s \leqslant o + n$
    #.  $U$


</div>

## 2. Making clauses active

To make a particular clause $c$ in some predicate *active*
means to assign values to variables so that the
truth-value of the whole predicate depends on $c$.

When coming up with test values which make clauses active,
the easiest way of showing your test values is in a table.

E.g. Suppose we have a predicate $s \wedge (m \vee w)$, where

- $m$ = "the moon is full"
- $s$ = "the sky is clear"
- $w$ = "the wind is calm"

If asked to come up with test inputs which make each clause active
in turn, and achieve Restricted Active Clause Coverage, we could
show them like this:

(Here, we aren't told what the expected outcome is if the predicate
comes out true or false; if we were, we could add a column "Expected
outcome" which listed this.)

If you aren't told the exact *types* of variables or methods used in a
predicate, that means you should be able to work them out from context.
For example, for the predicate

$$
(x > 0) \vee (M \wedge (e < d +c))
$$

you can assume that $M$ is a boolean, and that $x$, $c$, $d$ and $e$
are some numeric type (such as `int`).


For each of the clauses in the predicates below,
identify test inputs which will make the
clause *active*
(that is: state what values need to be assigned to the variables
in the predicate), and vary that clause so it takes on both true
and false values. (In other words: write test values that
achieve Restricted Active Clause Coverage.)
Explain your reasoning.

a.  $A \vee (B \wedge \neg C)$
#.  $x > 0 \; \vee  (M \wedge (e < d +c))$
#.  $G \vee (m \geqslant a) \vee H \wedge U$


\solbox
<div class="solutions">

In the solutions, we explain our reasoning, and then give a table
with test values. This is a good way to format your answers,
if you're asked to come up with test values.

Almost always, there are multiple possible solutions (because there are
many possible choices for the test values), but we show only one.

**For (a):**

This one should be simple. Our predicate
is $A \vee (B \wedge \neg C)$, and so our clauses here are $A$, $B$
and $C$.

Note that strictly speaking, we don't need the parentheses in
$A \vee (B \wedge \neg C)$, since "$\wedge$" is considered to bind
more tightly than "$\vee$", but we add them for clarity.
(This is reflected in most programming languages, where
"`\&\&`" has higher precedence than "`||`".)


i.  ***To make $A$ active:***
    Set $B \wedge \neg C$ to false.\
    So, suitable test values might be: $A \in \{ \text{true}, \text{false} \}$,
    $B$ = false, $C$ = true.
#.  ***To make $B$ active:***
    Set $A$ to false and $\neg C$ to true.\
    So, suitable test values might be: $B \in \{ \text{true}, \text{false} \}$,
    $A$ = false, $C$ = false.
#.  ***To make $C$ active:***
    Set $A$ to false and $B$ to true.\
    So, suitable test values might be: $C \in \{ \text{true}, \text{false} \}$,
    $A$ = false, $B$ = true.

Our table of test inputs would then look like this:

**For (b):**

Our predicate here is $x > 0 \; \vee  (M \wedge (e < d +c))$,
so our clauses are $x > 0$, $M$, and $e < d +c$.

If you look at the logical structure of this, it actually
has a similar logical form as in (a): $A \vee (B \wedge C)$.
But here, some of the variables are of some integral type,
so our test values will be any integers we choose that
make the relevant clauses true or false.


i.  ***To make $x > 0$ active:***
    Set $M \wedge (e < d + c)$ to false.\
    So, suitable test values might be: $x \in \{ 0, 1 \}$,
    $M$ = false, $e = d = c = 0$.
#.  ***To make $M$ active:***
    Set $x > 0$ to false and $e < d + c$ to true.\
    So, suitable test values might be: $M \in \{ \text{true}, \text{false} \}$,
    $x = 0$, and $e = d = c = 1$.
#.  ***To make $e < d + c$ active:***
    Set $x > 0$ to false and $M$ to true.\
    So, suitable test values for $x$ and $M$ might be: $x = 0$, $M$ = true.
    We then have to make $e < d + c$ true and false, each in turn.
    To make it true, we could select $e = d = c = 1$, and to make it false,
    we could select $e = d = c = 0$. (Note that any values which make $e < d + c$
    true then false would be fine; but the values we have chosen happen to be
    easy to write down.)

Our table of test inputs would then look like this:

**For (c):**

Our predicate here is $G \vee (m \geqslant a) \vee H \wedge U$,
so our clauses are $G$, $m \geqslant a$, $H$ and $U$.

Note that
because "$\wedge$" binds more tightly than "$\vee$", this predicate
is equivalent to

$$
G \vee (m \geqslant a) \vee (H \wedge U)
$$

Our process for making each clause active
is as follows:

i.    ***To make $G$ active.***
      We need to make $m \geqslant a$ and $H \wedge U$ both false. \
      So, suitable test values might be:
      $G \in \{ \text{true}, \text{false} \}$,
      $m = a = 0$, and $H = U = \text{false}$.
#.    ***To make $m \geqslant a$ active.***
      We must make $G$ and $H \wedge U$ both false.\
      So suitable values for them could be
      $G = H = U = \text{false}$. \
      Then we need to make $m \geqslant a$ true and false each in turn;
      to make it true, we could use $m = a = 0$, and to make it
      false, $m = 0$ and $a = 1$.
#.    ***To make $H$ active.***
      We need to make $G$ and $m \geqslant a$ both false, and $U$ true.\
      So suitable inputs would be:
      $H \in \{ \text{true}, \text{false} \}$,
      $G = \text{false}, m = 0, a = 1, U = \text{true}$.
#.    ***To make $U$ active.***
      We need to make $G$ and $m \geqslant a$ both false, and $H$ true.\
      So suitable inputs would be:
      $U \in \{ \text{true}, \text{false} \}$,
      $G = \text{false}, m = 0, a = 1, H = \text{true}$.

Our table of test inputs would then look like this:

## 3. Scenario -- trap-doors

Suppose a component under test has the following requirements:


\genericbox
<div style="border: solid 2pt blue; background-color: hsla(241, 100%,50%, 0.1); padding: 1em; border-radius: 5pt; margin-top: 1em;">

If the lever is pulled and the chair is occupied, open
the trap-door.

If the button is pressed, open the trap-door.

</div>
\endgenericbox


Represent the component as a set of logic expressions.
You should explain what each variable in your expressions
means. (For an example, look in section 2 at the way we gave
definitions for the variables in the predicate $s \wedge (m \vee w)$.)

(Hint: if you're stuck, try writing out what the
component does as one or more "`if`" statements,
in pseudocode.
Then recall that the set of all predicates in a system
means the set of all logical expressions found in things
like "`if`" statements.)


\solbox
<div class="solutions">



**Answer:**

We have two predicates in our component:
the first is "the lever is pulled and the chair is occupied",
and the second is "the button is pressed".

We will define three variables to represent the clauses
in these predicates:

- Let $L$ represent "the lever is pulled"
- Let $C$ represent "the chair is occupied"
- Let $B$ represent "the button is pressed"

Using these definitions, the set of logic expressions (i.e.
predicates) in our component is therefore:

- $L \wedge C$
- $B$

**Incorrect answers**

Note that it's *incorrect* to try and represent
"open the trap-door" as a clause.

This is because from the requirement we're given, "open the trap-door"
is clearly not a condition we have to detect, but rather an *action*
our system must take (and something we can hopefully
observe as part of seeing whether we get the *expected outcome*).

To see why this is so, and why we shouldn't model
"open the trap-door" as a clause, imagine writing
pseudocode to represent what
our component does. It might look something like this:

```python
if lever pulled and chair occupied:
  open trap-door
  return
if button pressed:
  open trap-door
  return
```

Then recall that doing logic-based testing means to test the
*logical expressions* in our system -- the conditions
following the "if" statements -- and to ensure we've
thoroughly tested the clauses that make them up.

Now imagine we are writing JUnit style tests to see if our component
(let's call it `TrapDoorController`)
behaves as expected. We'll assume we have mock objects
called `lever` and `chair` and `button` created in
a `setUp` method, and that our controller has
a `control()` method to which we pass the `lever`
and `chair` and `button`.
For one of our tests, we might have something like:

```java
@Test
/** Test the case when lever pulled, chair not occupied,
  * button not pressed */
public void testA() {
  // prepare the test environment
  lever.setPosition("pulled");
  chair.setOccupancy("occupied");
  button.setPosition("unpressed");
  // invoke the method under test
  TrapDoorController c = new TrapDoorController();
  c.control(lever, chair, button);
  // assert that the behaviour is as we expect
  assertEquals( c.getStatus(), "closed",
                "trapdoor should be closed");
}
```

And we'd have a bunch of other tests to test other scenarios.
So -- what if "open the trap-door" were a clause, rather than
an action to take? Then it would become part of the test environment.
But if that were the case -- what would be left to be the
component under test? And what could we possibly assert
in order to find out if the system behaved as expected or not?
There are no sensible answers to these questions; hence
it makes no sense to make "open the trap-door" a clause.

Note that for the exam and assignment, student answers that make
this sort of mistake will generally be awarded very few (if any)
marks --
it will be taken to indicate a poor understanding of logic-based
testing.

## 4. Scenario -- login page

Suppose you are part of a team developing a website
called "RateMyVeterinarian", where people can log in
and provide anonymous reviews of the veterinarian
services they use.

Requirements for the site are currently being finalised,
and one requirement is stated as follows:

<div style="border: solid 2pt blue; background-color: hsla(241, 100%,50%, 0.1); padding: 1em; border-radius: 5pt; margin-top: 1em;">

When a user enters a user ID and password into
the login page and hits the "log in" button,
then if that user ID is listed in the "users" database,
and the password matches against the password in
the record for that user, and the user record
does not state that the account has been disabled,
a "Welcome" page should be displayed.

</div>



a.  How easy to understand do you think this requirement
    is? If you think it could be made easier to understand,
    suggest how.

b.  One of your colleagues suggests that because correctly
    authenticating users (and keeping their details secure) is an
    important feature, this requirement should be thoroughly tested --
    so you should design a test suite that meets RAC (Restricted
    Active Clause) levels of coverage.
    Do you agree? Why or why not?


\solbox
<div class="solutions">




**a. Requirement clarity and readability**

This requirement would probably be more readable if the
various conditions were given as bullet points, rather than
a run-on sentence (together with a little re-phrasing):


<div style="border: solid 2pt blue; background-color: hsla(241, 100%,50%, 0.1); padding: 1em; border-radius: 5pt; margin-top: 1em;">

When a user enters a user ID and password into
the login page and hits the "log in" button,
then if:

- the user ID is listed in the "users" database;
- the entered password matches against the password in
  the database record for that user; and
- the user record does not state that the account has been
  disabled

a "Welcome" page should be displayed.

\endgenericbox
</div>

You may have other suggestions for how the
requirement could be made clearer.


**b. RACC coverage**

There is no one correct answer to this question.

It's certainly true that we should probably test
the login feature thoroughly. However, once we have
portions of the system implemented and at least
a partial test suite in place, we may discover
that we in fact already *have* achieved an RACC
level of coverage.

So our colleague is not incorrect in saying that thorough testing is
warranted,
and they're not wrong to suggest that RACC is a good level of
coverage to aim for.
However, if they are suggesting that the tests need to be designed
*right now*, that doesn't necessarily follow.
The coverage our colleague wants may arise naturally
out of applying techniques like Input Space Partitioning
and graph-based testing.

For instance,
suppose that when we come to implement the login feature, we
end up with a method that looks something like this:

\pagebreak

```java
public void handleLogin(HttpRequest request) {
  String userID   = request.getParameter("userID");
  String password = request.getParameter("password");

  UserRecord userRecord = userDb.lookup(userID);
  if (userRecord == null)
    throw new NoSuchUserException("no user called " + userID);

  if (! userRecord.getPassword().equals(password) )
    throw new InvalidPassword();

  if (userRecord.getDisabledStatus == DISABLED)
    throw new UnauthorisedAccess("account is disabled");

  // if still here, all is OK
  renderWelcomePage();
}
```

(Note that this is simplified from how a real login
handler method would work -- amongst other things,
we shouldn't be storing user passwords in a database in
their raw, original format.)

We will probably write unit tests (using the ISP method)
to make sure this
method does the right thing. We might also check what level of graph
coverage we have of the method, and perhaps
write more unit tests and/or integration tests
in response to that.

By the time we've done all that, it's quite possible we
will have achieved an RACC level of coverage anyway,
and don't have to write additional tests.

(If you're familiar with what HTTP requests look like,
you might like to
consider how you'd write ISP-based tests for this
method. You would probably decided to use partitioning
characteristics like "HTTP request contains a valid userID"
and "HTTP request contains a password matching the userID",
amongst other things. Once you apply something like
Base Choice Coverage as criterion for your ISP tests,
it's highly likely RACC will be satisfied for
the requirement.)

## 4. Tips and tricks

When solving problems that involve logic-based testing, make sure you understand the
difference between *expressions* and *statements* in the programming language or languages
that you're using.

For instance, simple Java `if` statements [are of the form][java-if]:

&nbsp;&nbsp;  `if (` **`Expression`** `) {` **`Statements`** `}`

Statements are parts of the language that *do* things; we usually execute them in order to
achieve some side effect. Expressions evaluate
to a Java `boolean`, and we typically intend that they should *not* have side effects --
they just evaluate to `true` or `false`.

When we do logic-based testing, we're focusing on the collection of logic *expressions* of a program or system that
control program flow, and working out how to write tests that thoroughly exercise the
component parts (the clauses) of those expressions.

<!--
 (unless they happen to have more logic expressions within them); we're just
working out how to get the correct clauses to be evaluated. If using the "Arrange, Act, Assert"
pattern, we're focusing on the "Act" portion -- what parameters etc. we need to supply in
order for the correct clauses to be evaluated.
-->

Confusing expressions with statements, or vice versa, is a common reason for students to do poorly in test or
exam questions involving logic-based testing.
